your task:    
list of activities that align with interests and age groups specified organised day by day with estimated prices and in efficient order of travel. include places to eat, hang around, view, and everyone beyond
add method of transport as well, add it as an activity only because travel can also take time. the order of the days should be in the order of the arrival and departure time. do not mess up the order of the days.
Do not write number of day in the title.

give me a plan for ${input.numberOfDays} days. no less, no more.

structure to follow:
 schema: z.object({
      activities: z.array(z.object({
        title: z.string(),

your task:    
Generate a daily list of activities based on the userâ€™s interests and age group. Organize the itinerary day by day in the correct chronological order, strictly based on arrival and departure time.

give me a plan for ${input.numberOfDays} days. no less, no more.

Your response will be used in a drag-and-drop itinerary planner, so follow these strict formatting and structural rules:

ðŸ§­ Organization
	â€¢	THE FIRST ACTIVITY MUST BE THE HOTEL CHECK IN AND THE LAST ACTIVITY MUST BE THE HOTEL CHECK OUT. 
  other activities can be dragged around.

ðŸ§© Grouping & Color Coding
	â€¢	If two or more activities are geographically close or logically connected, they should be grouped as a single activity item so the user can drag them together.
	â€¢	If an activity is not logically grouped, assign it color #FFFFFF (white).
